    "# Welcome to the Q-SEnSE Hackethon!\n",
    "### Follow the following instructions to learn how you can participate in this hackathon and submit solutions to our challenges &#11088;\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. All challenges are contained on this repo as jupiter notebooks. Your first step in participating in this hackathon is to fork this repo to make your own copy of all challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Once you have your own fork, select a challenge you would like to attempt by downloading that challenge's notebook onto your device.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Now it's time to get hacking! Each notebook contains helpful resources to help you get started. Develop your solution to the challenge and store your working code in the downloaded notebook for the challenge (you may have to create new code fields in the notebook bellow the instructions and examples).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. Once you are ready to submit your code, initiate a pull request which will propose as a solution to the challenge your updated version of the notebook containing your working code.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5. Solutions will be judged by someone representing the sponsor that submitted the challenge. A submission will be ranked by the quality of the code which endeavors to solve the challenge and the time that it was submitted (with two equivalent submissions being distinguished by which was submitted first).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Many thanks to Nvidia and Infleqtion for sponsoring this amazing event\n"
