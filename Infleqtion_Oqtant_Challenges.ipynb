    "# Oqtant Hackathon Challenges\n",
    "### These challenges are more data analysis and coding heavy than quantum but in the process the students will learn about time-of-flight (TOF) imaging, quantum interference and the resulting fringes. Their contributions can be shared publicly on Infleqtion's gitlab with credit and associated bragging rights."
